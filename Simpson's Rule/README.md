# Simpson's Rule
## This uses Simpson's 1/3 rule to integrate equally spaced tabulated data. If there is an unequal number of sections, a trapezoidal approxmation is used on the last section.

## Inputs:
### x = row vector of independent variables
### y = row vector of dependent variables evaluated at each independent value

## Outpus:
### I = approximate integral
