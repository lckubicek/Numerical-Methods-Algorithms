# LU Factorization
## This program obtains a lower and upper triangular matrix that can be implemented to solve a system of equations. This algorithm uses pivoting, but keeps track of it with a pivot matrix

## Inputs:
### A - coefficient matrix

## Outputs:
### L - lower triangular matrix
### U - upper triangular matrix
### P - the pivot matrix
